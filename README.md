The OCR Text Scanner app is designed to simplify the process of digitizing and managing text from images. Using advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and text recognition technologies, the app provides two key features:

1. Image to OCR Conversion: Users can capture or select images from their gallery, converting them into machine-readable text. The app supports batch processing of up to 10 images, allowing users to save individual images as JPGs or export all images as a PDF or JPG.

2. Text Recognition from Images: This feature enables users to capture or select images to directly extract text, which is displayed in a text box. Users can toggle the image display to view the text more clearly.

The app is built with Android Studio using Kotlin and leverages Google's ML Kit for accurate and efficient text extraction. It aims to enhance productivity for students, professionals, and anyone needing quick and easy text management solutions.
